#   No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available
#   HTML parser for this system ("..."). This usually isn't a problem,
#   but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual
#   environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.
#
# We are ok with any parser, and with how BeautifulSoup picks the best one if
# available. Explicitly using generic features (e.g. `('html', 'fast')`,
# the default) instead of a specific parser still warns.
#
# Currently there's no way to allow users to pick a parser, and we don't want
# to force a specific parser, so there's no point in warning.
#
# When changing this, also change the equivalent pytest.filterwarnings config.
